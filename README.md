# Python-calculator

## Design brief
#### I made the label window light blue because it contrasts well with the answers so it's easy to read. 
####I coloured the symbols and numbers differently so it's easy to determain which is which. 
#### The symbols are all down the same side so it makes them close together making them more accessible.
